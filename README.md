# üè† Homelab

## Introduction

This repo contains all of the configuration and documentation of my homelab.

The purpose of my homelab is to learn and to have fun. Being a Cloud Native Engineer by trade, I work with Kubernetes every day, and my homelab is the place where I can try out and learn new things. On the other hand, by self-hosting some applications, it makes me feel responsible for the entire process of deploying and maintaining an application from A to Z. It forces me to think about backup strategies, security, scalability and the ease of deployment and maintenance.

## Cluster Provisioning & Architecture

I use [K3s](https://k3s.io/) to set up my cluster. I prefer K3s because it is lightweight and minimal, optimized for edge and IoT environments while still providing production-grade capabilities.

## :computer: Hardware

### Nodes

I use Raspberry Pi computers for my cluster, which offer great performance in a small form factor with minimal power consumption.

- Raspberry Pi 4 Model B 8GB RAM (Master Node)
- Raspberry Pi 4 Model B 8GB RAM (Worker Node)

## Networking

I use [K3s](https://k3s.io/) with its built-in networking capabilities, which provides a simple yet powerful solution for container networking.

### Storage

My storage strategy revolves around persistent volumes managed by K3s with local paths. For backups, I use CloudNativePG's integration with AWS S3 to ensure data durability.

## Secret Management

AWS S3 and SOPS are used to securely store my secrets. I use flux to decrypt and apply these secrets to my cluster, ensuring sensitive information remains protected.
